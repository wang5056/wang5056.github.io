About me
======
I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio Group at Yale University. I completed my PhD in the Alex Chortos Group at Purdue University, where my research journey began. Since starting my doctoral studies, I have been dedicated to leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance the controllability and complexity of shape morphing in soft robotics. Additionally, I am committed to utilizing ML to elevate the motion performance of shape-morphing soft robots to match or even surpass biological levels. My research centers on the core themes of machine learning, shape morphing, and robotics. I have published papers in prestigious journals such as Science Advances (SA), Nature Communications (NC), Advanced Intelligent Systems (AIS), IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL), and Cyborg and Bionic Systems, with a paper currently under review in Science Robotics. My work also extends to areas including bioreactors, medical robotics, 3D printing, electrical actuators, wearable devices, and mechanism design.
