# excerpt: 'Conventional soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) are made of soft materials that facilitate safe interaction and adaptability. In positioning and loading tasks, however, SPAs demonstrate limited performance. In this article, we extend the current designs of SPAs upon integrating a tendon-driven parallel mechanism into a pneumatic origami chamber, inspired by the performances and structures of vertebrates. The inner rigid/outer soft actuator exploits the advantages of both, parallel mechanisms to achieve precise, versatile motion, and SPAs, to form a compliant, modular structure. With the antagonistic actuation of tendons-pulling and air-pushing, the actuator can exhibit multimode motion, tunable stiffness, and load-carrying maneuvers. Kinematic and quasi-static models are developed to predict the behavior and to control the actuator. Using readily accessible materials and fabrication methods, a prototype was built, on which validation experiments were conducted. The results prove the effectiveness of the model, and demonstrate the motion and stiffness characteristics of the actuator. The design strategy and comprehensive guidelines should expand the capabilities of soft robots for wider applications, and facilitate the development of robots with rigid-soft hybrid structures.'
