# excerpt: 'Programmable surfaces (PSs) consist of a 2D array of actuators that can deform in the third dimension, providing the ability to create continuous 3D profiles. Discrete PSs can be realized using an array of independent solid linear actuators. Continuous PSs consist of actuators that are mechanically coupled, providing deformation states that are more similar to real surfaces with reduced complexity of the control electronics. However, continuous PSs have been limited in size by the lack of the control systems required to take into account the complex internal coupling between actuators in the array. In this work, we computationally explore the deformation of a fully continuous PS with 81 independent actuation pixels based on ionic bending actuator. We establish a control strategy using machine learning (ML) regression models. Both forward and inverse control are achieved based on the training datasets which are derived from the finite element analysis (FEA) data of our PS. The prediction of surface deformation achieved by forward control with accuracy under 1% is 15000 times faster than FEM. And the real-time inverse control of continuous PSs that is to reproduce any arbitrary pre-defined surfaces, which possess high practical value for tactile display or human-machine interactive devices, is first proposed in the letter.'
