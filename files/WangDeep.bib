	abstract = {In the field of biomechanics, customizing complex strain fields according to specific requirements poses an important challenge for bioreactor technology, primarily due to the intricate coupling and nonlinear actuation of actuator arrays, which complicates the precise control of strain fields. This paper introduces a bioreactor designed with a 9 × 9 array of independently controllable dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), addressing this challenge. We employ image regression-based machine learning for both replicating target strain fields through inverse control and rapidly predicting feasible strain fields generated by the bioreactor in response to control inputs via forward control. To generate training data, a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation model was developed. In the FEA, the device was prestretched, followed by the random assignment of voltages to each pixel, yielding 10,000 distinct output strain field images for the training set. For inverse control, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is utilized to predict control inputs from images, whereas, for forward control, MLP maps control inputs to low-resolution images, which are then upscaled to high-resolution outputs through a super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN). Demonstrations include inputting biomechanically significant strain fields, where the method successfully replicated the intended fields. Additionally, by using various tumor–stroma interfaces as inputs, the bioreactor demonstrated its ability to customize strain fields accordingly, showcasing its potential as an advanced testbed for tumor biomechanics research.},
